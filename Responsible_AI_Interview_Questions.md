# Responsible AI Interview Questions
The ecosystem of organisations developing and usine artificial intelligence (AI) systems and research is vast and complex.
For some, AI comes with great potential to increase profit margins.
For others, AI poses serious challenges to their reputation, security and sustainability.

Wherever your company or charity sits on this spectrum, it is key that staff developing AI tools, staff making decisions about tech procurement, and staff exposed to AI in the workplace all have a keen sense of the limitations of AI systems and research.

Below, you may find a series of interview questions to ensure that job candidates are aware of the limitations of the systems they develop, implement or use.
Crucially, these questions help job candidates understand that your organisation values responsible research and innovation.

The questions are categorised according to your type of organisation or the department you are recruiting for: either innovators, buyers or end users.¹
* **Innovators:** These are the people and organisations who are developing the latest AI. For example, these questions are useful for engineers, data scientists and product managers.
*	**Buyers:** These are the people and organisations who make decisions about procuring and implementing technologies that impact fellow staff and memebers of the public. For example, these questions can help recruit for HR, finance, operations and IT departments. Schools, hospitals and other public service organisations can also gain from using these questions.
*	**End users:** These are individuals who use AI technologies – in other words, all employees.
The questions are intentionally vague, so that they apply to many contexts. Notwithstanding, the questions are paired with criteria against which you may assess job candidates’ responsible AI readiness. We encourage you to reach out via hello@kairoi.uk for us to help you design more tailored questions.

| You are free to copy and adapt these questions. Whilst we don’t expect you to acknowledge that the questions are from this repository during interviews, we encourage you to cite this resource in recruitment and other HR reports as follows: “Based on Responsible AI Interview Questions by Kairoi Ltd (2023) / kairoi.uk / CC-BY 4.0” |
