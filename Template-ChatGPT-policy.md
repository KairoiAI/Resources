# Template ChatGPT Use Policy
This is a sample ChatGPT Use Policy from Kairoi that you can use to create your own policy for your organisation.
The policy is developed in the spirit of other use policies we find in the workplace.
For example, there are often limitations on how employees can use the internet at work, including certain sites such as Facebook or TikTok.
Other workplace policies might remind us to use public wifi networks with caution, or how to ensure the safety of emails we receive.
With the great potential for tools like ChatGPT to support the work we do, it is crucial that we use it safely and responsibly.
Take a look at our [blog post](https://kairoi.uk/blog/generative-ai-use-policy/) outlining four reasons organisations need clear and robust use policies for generative AI tools.

## Using this template
1. This policy specifically governs the use of ChatGPT in the workplace, but you are encouraged to apply it to other AI systems that may be in use at your organisation.
2. Should you apply it to different systems or to types of technologies more generally (e.g.: "generative AI tools"), make sure to provide a definition of impacted systems, as well as a list of relevant tools.
If you only provide a definition of the technologies the policy covers, it can be difficult for staff to know whether a certain tool is affected or not.
Conversely, if you only provide a list of systems covered by the policy, it is likely that other tools can be used instead, and possibly at even greater risk.
3. You may also choose to integrate this policy into a broader Internet Use Policy if you have one, rather than having a specific policy for ChatGPT.
4. The template policy below serves as a starting point for governing the use of ChatGPT in the workplace.
We advise that you adapt it and reference specific activities pertinent to your organisation’s industry or domain.
5. The template makes reference to a _Computer Use Policy_ (which your IT department might have) and to intellectual property clauses in employment contracts.
Please make sure to reference your organisation’s own policies and adapt as needed. It is key that this policy is consistent with other internal policies you may have.
6. This template is free for you to use, adapt and share.
You are also encouraged to provide feedback onthe template by commenting on the related [issue]([url](https://github.com/KairoiAI/Resources/issues/1)) (requires signing in to GitHub).
7. If you want support in effectively designing and rolling out AI-related policies that educate your staff and protect your organisation, please reach out to use at Kairoi via hello@kairoi.uk.

# ChatGPT Use Policy
## Context and Scope
Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly useful and accessible.
In particular, generative AI tools have become a part of many professionals’ workflows.
Generative AI tools include those that produce text or images in response to queries.
They are an accessible way to interact with large language models (LLMs), AI systems trained on enormous amounts of data.
In that training process, LLMs require huge compute resources.
In practice, text-to-image tools can be used by publishers to create visuals, and artists to aid them through the creative process.
Similarly, chatbots based on LLMs can help write blogposts, emails and reports.
ChatGPT is one such LLM-based chatbot.

ChatGPT serves as an interface to interact with an LLM that is trained on enormous amounts of data.
When inputting a prompt in ChatGPT, we are basically interacting with all the data it was trained on.
Through different machine learning techniques, ChatGPT is also trained to predict the next word in a sentence, which allows its responses to sound natural and even compelling.
However, ChatGPT can provide factually incorrect information, is easily manipulated, and is further trained by the prompts users provide.

At **[org name]**, we do not encourage the usage of ChatGPT, but we acknowledge that staff may value integrating the tool into their workflows.
**[Org name]** will not provide you with login credentials but, if you choose to use ChatGPT, you may do so by signing up with a personal email and mobile number at https://chat.openai.com/, notwithstanding the present policy.
It is expressly forbidden for you to create an account to use ChatGPT with **[org name]** email addresses or phone numbers.

The present policy sets out general guidelines, as well as forbidden and acceptable uses of ChatGPT, to ensure the safety of staff, the company, and our partners, clients and suppliers.
Whilst **[org name]** cannot monitor your use of ChatGPT on personal devices, we do have a **[_Computer Use Policy_]** whereby your use of devices of **[org name]**’s property are subject to relevant monitoring procedures.
The present _ChatGPT Use Policy_ complements and in no way supersedes **[org name]**’s **[_Computer Use Policy_]**, and applies to all staff employed by or seconded to **[org name]**.

At **[org name]**, we value the potential for novel technologies to aid us in our mission. However, we are accutely aware of the limitations of AI systems. This policy is in place to ensure that the use of ChatGPT at **[org name]** is safe and responsible.

## General Guidelines
It is good practice to keep the following in mind when using ChatGPT:
* ChatGPT is a tool, similar to using Google to browse the internet, or Word to write documents
* When you type into ChatGPT, you are giving information to the system’s developers at OpenAI
* Always ask yourself whether ChatGPT is the best tool for the task at hand (ask your colleagues or supervisor if you're not sure)
* Each time you start a new chat on ChatGPT, you are starting “from scratch” in the sense that it cannot reference other chats you had with it
* ChatGPT can provide inaccurate information, and all its responses must be carefully checked for errors
* ChatGPT is best used to feed back on one’s own work, and not to scrutinise others’ efforts
* When seeking feedback on text or code, it’s safest to provide only snippets to ensure you are minimising the amount of information divulged
* If you don’t want something to be in the public domain, then don’t type it into ChatGPT!

## Forbidden Uses
ChatGPT cannot be used in ways that may undermine **[org name]**’s security and reputation. When using ChatGPT:
* You may not sign up to ChatGPT using company credentials (work email and phone number)
* You may not divulge sensitive information, such as passwords, addresses, bank details or phone numbers
* You may not type out or paste draft contracts, such as employment contracts or contracts with clients or providers
* You may not type out or paste documents that may contain business-sensitive data, such as draft annual reports, business cases and accounting reports
* You may not seek feedback on job applicants’ CVs by pasting them in in part or in full
* You may not type out or paste proprietary code, documents or other information that is not intended for the public eye
* You may not type out or paste content that is subject to copyright licenses that do not allow for their indiscriminate sharing

Failure to comply with this section of the present policy will result in disciplinary action and can lead to termination of employment.

## Acceptable Uses
ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can help streamline certain processes, revise text and structure thoughts. Below are suggested ways you can make the most of ChatGPT in a responsible way.
* Ask for a spell-check to ensure proper grammar (for example: "Please check the grammar of this sentence: "these processes must be seperated"")
* Ask for better ways to word a sentence (for example: “What's a better way of saying "our service is faster and more efficient"?”)
* Ask for the outline of reports if it is the first report of the sort (for example: “What's a useful outline of a recruitment report?”)
* Ask for the outline of a blogpost for inspiration (for example: I need to write a blogpost introducing privacy-enhancing technologies – how could it be structured?”)
* Ask for feedback on snippets of code or help with Excel formulas (for example: "I am using Excel. Column A has the price "$10" and column B has the number of items offered at this rate ("2"). How do I get the price per item in column C?")

## **[Org name]**’s Promise to You
At **[org name]**, we value the privacy and intellectual property rights of our employees. Whilst **[org name]** may monitor your use of devices property of **[org name]**, we will not increase our monitoring for the purpose of ChatGPT. Unless there is reason to suspect a breach of the present policy, monitoring by the IT department will continue in line with the **[_Computer Use Policy_]**.

Furthermore, under **[org name]**’s view, all ChatGPT’s outputs are of the user’s intellectual property, unless either:
* Resulting from prompts involving information from **[org name]**, rendering **[org name]** the rightful intellectual property owner; or
* The outputs are directly relevant to an employee or secondee's work, such that the intellectual property clause in your contract is enforced.

## Version Control
The present policy is to be reviewed by **[relevant department]** every **six** months.
