# Template ChatGPT Use Policy
This is a sample ChatGPT Use Policy from Kairoi that you can use to create your own policy for your organisation. The policy is developed in the spirit of other use policies we find in the workplace. For example, there are often limitations on how employees can use the internet at work, including certain sites such as Facebook or TikTok. With the great potential for tools like ChatGPT to support the work we do, it is crucial that we use it safely and responsibly. Whilst this policy is targeted at ChatGPT, you are encouraged to apply it to other AI systems that may be in use at your organisation.

You are free to share and adapt this resource, so long as you give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. We advise that you reference specific activities pertinent to your organisation’s industry or domain. There is also reference to “Computer Use Policy”, which your IT department might have. Please make sure to reference your organisation’s own policies.

## Context and Scope
Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly useful and accessible. In particular, generative AI systems have become a part of many professionals’ workflows. Generative AI systems include those that produce text or.images in response to queries. In practice, text-to-image tools can be used by publishers to create visuals, and artists to aid them through the creative process. Similarly, chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) can help write blogposts, emails and reports. LLMs are AI systems that produce text based on enourmous amounts of text used as training data. ChatGPT is one such LLM-based chatbot.

ChatGPT is an online chatbot that can be used for free by signing up with an email and mobile number. Whilst [org name] cannot provide you with login credentials nor monitor your use of ChatGPT on personal devices, we do have a Computer Use Policy whereby your use of devices of [org name]’s property are subject to relevant monitoring procedures. The present ChatGPT Use Policy complements and in no way supersedes [org name]’s Computer Use Policy, and applies to all staff employed by or seconded to [org name].

At [org name], we value the potential for novel technologies to aid us in our mission. However, we are accutely aware of the limitations of AI systems. This policy is in place to ensure that the use of ChatGPT at [org name] is safe and responsible.

## General Guidelines
It is good practice to keep the following in mind when using ChatGPT:
* ChatGPT is a tool, like using Google to browse the internet, or Word to write documents
* When you type into ChatGPT, you are giving information to the system’s developers at OpenAI
* Each time you start a new chat on ChatGPT, you are starting “from scratch” in the sense that it cannot reference other chats you had with it
* ChatGPT can provide inaccurate information, and all its responses must be keenly checked for errors
* ChatGPT is best used to feed back on one’s own work, and not to scrutinise others’ efforts
* When seeking feedback on text, it’s safest to provide only snippets, simply to ensure you are minimising the amount of information divulged
* If you don’t want something to be in the public domain, then don’t type it into ChatGPT!

## Forbidden Uses
ChatGPT cannot be used in ways that may undermine [org name]’s security and reputation. When using ChatGPT, you may not:
* Divulge sensitive information, such as passwords, addresses, bank details or phone numbers
* Type out or paste draft contracts, such as employment contracts or contracts with clients or providers
* Type out or paste documents that may contain business-sensitive data, such as draft annual reports, business cases and accounting reports
* Seek feedback on job applicants’ CVs by pasting them in in part or in full
* Type out or paste proprietary code, documents or other information that is not intended for the public eye
* Type out or paste content that is subject to copywrite licenses that do not allow for their indiscriminate sharing
Failure to comply with this section of the present policy will result in disciplinary action and can lead to termination of employment.

## Acceptable Uses
ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can help streamline certain processes, revise text and structure thoughts. Below are suggested ways you can make the most of ChatGPT in a responsible way.
* Ask for a spell-check to ensure proper grammar (for example: "Please check the grammar of this sentence: "these processes must be seperated"")
* Ask for better ways to word a sentence (for example: “What's a better way of saying "our service is faster and more efficient"?”)
* Ask for the outline of reports if it is the first report of the sort (for example: “What's a useful outline of a recruitment report?”)Ask for the outline of a blogpost for inspiration (for example: I need to write a blogpost introducing privacy-enhancing technologies – how could it be structured?”)

## [Org name]’s Promise to You
At [org name], we value the privacy and intellectual property rights of our employees. Whilst [org name] may monitor your use of devices property of [org name], we will not increase our monitoring for the purpose of ChatGPT. Unless there is reason to suspect a breach of the present policy, monitoring by the IT department will continue in line with the Computer Use Policy.

Furthermore, under [org name]’s view, all ChatGPT’s outputs are of the user’s intellectual property, unless, either:
* Resulting from prompts involving information from [org name], rendering [org name] the rightful intellectual property owner; or
* The outputs are directly relevant to your work as an employee, such that the intellectual property clause in your contract is enforced.
