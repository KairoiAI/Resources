Where possible, Kairoi endeavours to make resources publicly available.
This is both to give back to the responsible AI community, and to be open to scrutiny.
We believe that organisational governance is at its best when built and delivered transparently.
Our resources improve tremendously through community involvement.

The below principles serve as behavioural guidelines to adhere to when engaging with Kairoi and the community through our GitHub repositories.
They are based on [this](https://github.com/KairoiAI/An_Incomplete_History_of_Research_Ethics/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md) _Code of Conduct_

* _Duty of care_ is paramount. We are all here to learn from one another and that requires that we all feel safe and included in discussions, even when they get heated. Kindness is key to the success of Kairoi's vision for responsible AI.
* _Honesty_ in engaging with views and interpretations that differ from our own, and in providing evidence to argue for one's position. It also means being honest about the contributions we make. When resources are published, contributors will be contacted to confirm they are happy to be acknowledged as such.
* _Humility_ relates to honesty insofar that we must be honest with our own limitations. Contributors must be open to others' perspectives and accepting that someone else may be more knowledgeable about a certain domain.
* _Charitability_ is about treating all perspectives with the same due diligence. No perspective is automatically better than another, and adequate argumentation is necessary to overcome differences.
* _Open communication_ calls for discussions about resources published on GitHub to _preferably_ be maintained publicly. This is not to enforce full transparency but the go-to method for discussing and improving resources is by commenting on their pertinent issues.
* _Impartiality_ from political, financial or ideological pressure groups. The resources are made freely available and should not be influenced by hidden agendas.
* _Sustainability_, which hinges on contributors adhering to the present code of conduct.
